	- History of mobile application
		1. The Platform SDKs (Only one platform) 
		2. WebViews (Multi platform but need JavaScript bridge to render HTML to canvans(to view))

		4. Flutter (Multi platform and not need JavaScript bridge, render widgets redirectly to canvans)

	- What is Flutter and why choose Flutter?
		1. Flutter is framework "one code base for many platforms" 
		2. The advantages of reactive views, with no JavaScript bridge
		3. Fast, smooth, and predictable; code compiles AOT to native (ARM) code
